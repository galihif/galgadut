# galgadut

Hello, world!

This is the Galgadut portfolio website. I create this project while I am learning front-end web development in @sandhikagalih 's youtube channel. In his video, he taught me to make a personal portfolio website using CSS framework materialize. It took me a week to make this website because I'm very new in this field. This website has some information about me like profile, educational background, achievements, experiences, contact, etc.
